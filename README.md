# Project 2

**Title:** 
[Loan Application, Approval and Risk Insights (2019–2024)](https://github.com/AkinolaArilewola/akinolamccarthy.github.io/blob/main/Loan.xlsx)

**Tools Used:**

•	Microsoft Excel — Data Cleaning, Analysis, and Visualization
•	Excel Power Query — Data Transformation
•	Excel Charts and Pivot Tables — Dashboard Design and Metrics Analysis
•	Custom Formulas: For calculating approval rates, credit score averages, income ratios, and risk scores
•	Conditional Formatting: To highlight approval trends and risk categories

**Project Description:**

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of loan applications processed by Vazskit Loans Ltd from 2019 to 2024. The aim is to gain deeper insights into loan approval trends, applicant demographics, and financial risk factors influencing credit decisions.
Using Excel, I developed an interactive dashboard that allows stakeholders to explore key metrics such as total applications, approval rates, credit score patterns, and risk categories. The analysis also evaluates the relationships between age, employment, marital status, income levels, and loan approval outcomes.
The dashboard serves as a data-driven decision-making tool to help financial analysts and risk managers identify areas for improvement and understand the creditworthiness patterns of borrowers.


**Key findings:**

•	 20,000 total loan applications were received across all loan types.

•	 £497.7M total loan amount was requested, of which £91.5M was approved.

•	 The average credit score of applicants stood at 572, with an overall loan approval rate of 23.9%.

•	Medium-risk applicants accounted for the largest proportion of applications and approvals.

•	 The age group 31–40 years had the highest number of approved loans, indicating prime earning years are linked to stronger credit profiles.

•	 Homeowners (42%) and those with mortgages had a higher loan approval rate compared to renters.

•	 Employed applicants dominated approvals, with 4,089 approvals compared to only 253 for the unemployed.

•	 Approved applicants had an average annual income of £102,211, compared to £45,641 for those rejected.

•	 Married applicants (50%) were more likely to secure loans, possibly reflecting financial stability.

# Project 3

**Title:**
Employee Data Analysis — HR Database

**SQL Code:**
[HR Database-SQL code](https://github.com/AkinolaArilewola/akinolamccarthy.github.io/blob/main/Employee.SQL)


**SQL Skills Used:**

Data Retrieval (SELECT): Queried and extracted employee and salary details based on specific conditions.

Filtering (WHERE, BETWEEN, LIKE): Filtered records based on salary range, location, manager, and name patterns.

Data Aggregation (COUNT, MAX, MIN, AVG): Calculated employee counts, and statistical insights into salary distributions.

Data Deduplication (DISTINCT): Identified unique project names and removed duplicates from results.

Conditional Logic (OR, AND): Combined multiple criteria to extract flexible query results.

Set Operations (UNION): Combined employee records from multiple tables to identify unique employee IDs.

String Pattern Matching (LIKE, Wildcards): Queried employees whose names followed specific letter sequences.

Arithmetic Operations: Calculated total compensation by combining base salary and variable pay components.



**Project Description:**

This project focuses on analyzing employee and salary information from an HR database using SQL Server. The goal is to answer key stakeholder questions regarding employee management, salary structures, and project assignments.

As part of the HR analytics initiative, stakeholders requested insights to better understand:
